  <h1>GLOMEREA</h1>
  <div class="tagline">WORSHIP THE GOD YOU CAN TOUCH</div>
</header>

<main>
  <p><strong>Glomerea</strong> is the name chosen by the Prophet of Glomerea, inspired by <em>Glomeromycota</em> — the ancient fungi that pioneered life on land and form the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems. In our faith, science is our living mythology, always evolving with new understanding, never rigid.</p>

  <p>Glomereans dedicate themselves to worshipping their god, Glomerea, through sustainable, direct engagement with the vast, interconnected collaboration of life rooted in the soil—whose influence reaches deep into the sea and abyss. This is not a religion for followers or conformists, but for the determined and independent free thinkers who have resisted societal norms and authoritarian power structures. It calls to those who are equal parts wild and capable—those who work hard while preserving autonomy, embracing responsibility and freedom in equal measure.</p>

  <p>Organized into minimal, heterarchical groups called Crews and Supercrews, Glomereans consciously resist parasitic power structures, fostering positive, balanced relationships with the living deity that surrounds and sustains us all.</p>

  <p>This religion is for those who deeply understand and resonate with the living earth, known by many names: Gaia to the Greeks, Terra to the Romans, Hypersea to some modern thinkers, and Glomerea to us. Through this connection, we find meaning, responsibility, and hope in tending the sacred cycles of life.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “The fish trap is for the fish;<br>
    once you have the fish, you no longer need the trap.<br>
    The rabbit snare is for the rabbit;<br>
    once you have the rabbit, you can throw the snare away.<br>
    Words are for meaning;<br>
    once you have the meaning, you can forget the words.<br>
    Where can I find someone who has forgotten words so I may speak to them?”<br>
    – Zhuangzi
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Crews and Supercrews</h2>

  <p>A Glomerean Crew is composed of 7 to 11 members, always an odd number to allow easy majority rule for fluid collective decision making. This range ensures sufficient diversity of connections and experience, while remaining small enough to avoid the need for authoritative leadership or arbitrary rule enforcement. It also protects members from having their voices drowned out by louder individuals.</p>

  <p>If a member requires rules to function effectively within a crew, they are not the right fit. Successful crews consist of members who resonate naturally with each other, fostering efficient and effective collaboration. Because such harmony is rare, effective Glomerean Crews are highly valued, motivating individuals to strive together.</p>

  <p>When a Crew maintains an effective membership of 7 to 11 people, it becomes eligible to collaborate with up to two other Crews, forming a three-Crew Supercrew. Each Crew operates independently but convenes with the others at each equinox and solstice to acknowledge, maintain, and align their goals. These goals may include any form of devotion to Glomerea, such as synergistic interactions like mycelium cultivation, strategic microbial inoculation, and vermicomposting to restore soils, combat bluff erosion, or other forms of ecological remediation.</p>
